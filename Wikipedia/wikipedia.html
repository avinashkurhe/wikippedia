                    <b>John McCarthy</b>
                    (September 4, 1927 – October 24, 2011) was an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist.
                    He was one of the founders of
                    the discipline of artificial intelligence.[1] He co-authored the document that coined the term
                    "artificial intelligence" (AI), developed the programming language family Lisp, significantly
                    influenced the design of the language ALGOL, popularized time-sharing, and invented garbage
                    collection.
                </p>
                <p> McCarthy spent most of his career at Stanford University.[2] He received many accolades and honors,
                    such as the 1971 Turing Award for his contributions to the topic of AI,[3] the United States
                    National Medal of Science, and the Kyoto Prize.</p>

                <h3>Early life and education</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    John McCarthy was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on September 4, 1927, to an Irish immigrant father
                    and a Lithuanian Jewish immigrant mother,[4] John Patrick and Ida (Glatt) McCarthy. The family was
                    obliged to relocate frequently during the Great Depression, until McCarthy's father found work as an
                    organizer for the Amalgamated Clothing Workers in Los Angeles, California. His father came from
                    Cromane, a small fishing village in County Kerry, Ireland.[5] His mother died in 1957.[6]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both parents were active members of the Communist Party during the 1930s, and they encouraged
                    learning and critical thinking. Before he attended high school, McCarthy became interested in
                    science by reading a translation of 100,000 Whys, a Russian popular science book for children.[7] He
                    was fluent in the Russian language and made friends with Russian scientists during multiple trips to
                    the Soviet Union, but distanced himself after making visits to the Soviet Bloc, which led to him
                    becoming a conservative Republican.[8]
                </p>
                <p>
                    McCarthy graduated from Belmont High School two years early[9] and was accepted into Caltech in
                    1944.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He showed an early aptitude for mathematics; during his teens, he taught himself college math by
                    studying the textbooks used at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech). As a result,
                    he was able to skip the first two years of math at Caltech.[10] He was suspended from Caltech for
                    failure to attend physical education courses.[11] He then served in the US Army and was readmitted,
                    receiving a BS in mathematics in 1948.[12]
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was at Caltech that he attended a lecture by John von Neumann that inspired his future endeavors.

                    McCarthy completed his graduate studies at Caltech before moving to Princeton University, where he
                    received a PhD in mathematics in 1951 with his dissertation "Projection operators and partial
                    differential equations", under the supervision of Donald C. Spencer.[13]

                <h3>Academic career</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>After short-term appointments at Princeton and Stanford University, McCarthy became an assistant
                    professor at Dartmouth in 1955.

                    A year later, he moved to MIT as a research fellow in the autumn of 1956. By the end of his years at
                    MIT he was already affectionately referred to as "Uncle John" by his students.[14]

                    In 1962, he became a full professor at Stanford, where he remained until his retirement in 2000.

                    McCarthy championed mathematics such as lambda calculus and invented logics for achieving common
                    sense in artificial intelligence.</p>

            <p style="float: left;">
                John McCarthy is one of the "founding fathers" of artificial intelligence, together with Alan Turing,
                Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell, and Herbert A. Simon. McCarthy, Minsky, Nathaniel Rochester and Claude E.
                Shannon
                coined the term "artificial intelligence" in a proposal that they wrote for the famous Dartmouth
                conference in Summer 1956. This conference started AI as a field.[9][15] (Minsky later joined McCarthy
                at MIT in
                1959.)
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1958, he proposed the advice taker, which inspired later work on question-answering and logic
                programming.
                In the late 1950s, McCarthy discovered that primitive recursive functions could be extended to compute
                with
                symbolic expressions, producing the Lisp programming language.[16] That functional programming seminal
                paper
                also introduced the lambda notation borrowed from the syntax of lambda calculus in which later dialects
                like
                Scheme based its semantics. Lisp soon became the programming language of choice for AI applications
                after
                its publication in 1960.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1958, McCarthy served on an Association for Computing Machinery ad hoc committee on Languages that
                became
                part of the committee that designed ALGOL 60. In August 1959 he proposed the use of recursion and
                conditional expressions, which became part of ALGOL.[17] He then became involved with developing
                international standards in programming and informatics, as a member of the International Federation for
                Information Processing (IFIP) IFIP Working Group 2.1 on Algorithmic Languages and Calculi,[18] which
                specified, maintains, and supports ALGOL 60 and ALGOL 68.[19]
            </p>
            <p>
                Around 1959, he invented so-called "garbage collection" methods, a kind of automatic memory management,
                to
                solve problems in Lisp.[20][21]
            </p>
            <p>
                During his time at MIT, he helped motivate the creation of Project MAC, and while at Stanford
                University, he
                helped establish the Stanford AI Laboratory, for many years a friendly rival to Project MAC.
            </p>
            <p>
                McCarthy was instrumental in the creation of three of the very earliest time-sharing systems (Compatible
                Time-Sharing System, BBN Time-Sharing System, and Dartmouth Time Sharing System). His colleague Lester
                Earnest told the Los Angeles Times:
            </p>
            <p>
                The Internet would not have happened nearly as soon as it did except for the fact that John initiated
                the
                development of time-sharing systems. We keep inventing new names for time-sharing. It came to be called
                servers ... Now we call it cloud computing. That is still just time-sharing. John started it.[9]
            </p>
            <p>
                — Elaine Woo
                In 1961, he was perhaps the first to suggest publicly the idea of utility computing, in a speech given
                to
                celebrate MIT's centennial: that computer time-sharing technology might result in a future in which
                computing power and even specific applications could be sold through the utility business model (like
                water
                or electricity).[22][23] This idea of a computer or information utility was very popular during the late
                1960s, but had faded by the mid-1990s. However, since 2000, the idea has resurfaced in new forms (see
                application service provider, grid computing, and cloud computing).
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1966, McCarthy and his team at Stanford wrote a computer program used to play a series of chess games
                with counterparts in the Soviet Union; McCarthy's team lost two games and drew two games (see
                Kotok-McCarthy).
            </p>
            <p>
                From 1978 to 1986, McCarthy developed the circumscription method of non-monotonic reasoning.

                In 1982, he seems to have originated the idea of the space fountain, a type of tower extending into
                space
                and kept vertical by the outward force of a stream of pellets propelled from Earth along a sort of
                conveyor
                belt which returns the pellets to Earth. Payloads would ride the conveyor belt upward.[24]

            <hr>
            <p>
                McCarthy often commented on world affairs on the Usenet forums. Some of his ideas can be found in his
                sustainability Web page,[25] which is "aimed at showing that human material progress is desirable and
                sustainable". McCarthy was an avid book reader, an optimist, and a staunch supporter of free speech. His
                best Usenet interaction is visible in rec.arts.books archives. He actively attended SF Bay Area dinners
                in Palo Alto of r.a.b. readers, called rab-fests. He went on to defend free speech criticism involving
                European ethnic jokes at Stanford.[26]
            </p>
            <p>

                McCarthy saw the importance of mathematics and mathematics education. His Usenet .sig for years was, "He
                who refuses to do arithmetic is doomed to talk nonsense"; his license plate cover read, similarly, "Do
                the arithmetic or be doomed to talk nonsense."[27][28] He advised 30 PhD graduates.[29]
            </p>
            <p>
                His 2001 short story "The Robot and the Baby"[30] farcically explored the question of whether robots
                should have (or simulate having) emotions, and anticipated aspects of Internet culture and social
                networking that became increasingly prominent during ensuing decades.[31]

                Personal life
                McCarthy was married three times. His second wife was Vera Watson, a programmer and mountaineer who died
                in 1978 attempting to scale Annapurna I Central as part of an all-women expedition. He later married
                Carolyn Talcott, a computer scientist at Stanford and later SRI International.[32][33]

                McCarthy declared himself an atheist in a speech about artificial intelligence at Stanford Memorial
                Church.[34][35][36] Raised as a Communist, he became a conservative Republican after a visit to
                Czechoslovakia in 1968 after the Soviet invasion.[37] He died at his home in Stanford on October 24,
                2011.[38]

            <h3>Philosophy of artificial intelligence</h3>
            <hr>
            <p>In 1979 McCarthy wrote an article[39] entitled "Ascribing Mental Qualities to Machines". In it he wrote,
                "Machines as simple as thermostats can be said to have beliefs, and having beliefs seems to be a
                characteristic of most machines capable of problem-solving performance." In 1980 the philosopher John
                Searle responded with his famous Chinese Room Argument,[40][15] disagreeing with McCarthy and taking the
                stance that machines cannot have beliefs simply because they are not conscious. Searle argues that
                machines lack intentionality. A vast amount of literature [example needed] has been written in support
                of one side or the other.</p>
